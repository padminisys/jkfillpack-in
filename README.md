Rules to work as paid open source contributor ! 

At Padmini Systems We offer Paid open source contribution Task in terms of issues/task (Github issues)

Each issue have payment linked and 2 hours of developers efforts can be logged against. We will create issue with label - ready that means you can start on this and get paid.

There could be many issue but don't get overwheled with it, just contact us - we can always let you know what's up for you so you can just begin to work. 

Usually each issue is very much self explnatory but you can always reach out to us or leave comment so we can respond on it.

We want you to follow following rules of contribution - 

Commitment of words - 
If you made agreement verbally and next step is communicated to you from our side then you are to be committed. For example - You have agreed on the call this design would be implemented by XX time/date and PR would be ready by then, we are waiting to hear back from you.

Timely response - If you get into any issue by any chance then you could have communicated in advance before you fail in commitment.

Commitment to quality -Quality commitment in code and design will not be always documented in detail, as long as you understood goal of design and high level design you can drive the changes but there should be approprite level of coding standard and design principle should be followed. Like if you have been asked to create landing page design with few options or sample provided then deviation to downgrade without consent considered quality compromized.

Raise timely concern or issues - Issue and concerned, doubt, queries and errors comes all the time in developers life, it all starts to have negative impact if you delay reporting. You can absolutely work on this and you own it, but reporting helps quicker resolutions. At first tech leads at padmini systems provides you consulting with resources to troubleshoot if that doesn't help then you can get into quick call over screen share work with our experts to address and get support in the call.
