## Contribution Guidelines 📜

### 1. Commitment of Words 🤝
- **Honor Your Agreements:**  
  If you have made a verbal agreement and received further instructions from our side, please stick to your commitment.  
  *Example:* If you agreed on a call to implement a design by a certain deadline or to submit a PR by a specified time, we expect you to follow through.

### 2. Timely Response ⏰
- **Keep Us Informed:**  
  Should you encounter any issues, please communicate them as early as possible. This proactive approach helps prevent missed deadlines and ensures smooth progress.

### 3. Commitment to Quality ✅
- **Uphold High Standards:**  
  While detailed quality guidelines might not be explicitly documented for every task, it’s crucial to understand the overall design goals and principles.  
  Your code should adhere to established coding standards and design principles. Any deviation that negatively impacts quality without prior consent is considered a compromise.

### 4. Raise Timely Concerns 🚨
- **Report Issues Promptly:**  
  It’s normal to encounter doubts or errors during development. However, delaying the reporting of these issues can have a negative impact on the project.  
  Our tech leads are available for consulting and troubleshooting. If needed, we can arrange a quick screen share call to resolve issues in real time.
