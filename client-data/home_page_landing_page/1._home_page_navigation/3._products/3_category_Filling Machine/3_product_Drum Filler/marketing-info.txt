Experience precision and efficiency with our advanced Drum Filling Machine, designed to deliver reliable and accurate filling for a variety of industrial applications. With a weigh-based system ensuring filling accuracy up to ±0.25% across a range of 20 to 50 liters, every drum is filled to perfection. The innovative “No container, No fill” feature guarantees that only properly placed containers are filled, eliminating waste and ensuring operational safety.

Designed for seamless operation, this machine features auto movement of drummies on the filling area and is controlled by a sophisticated PLC-based system for easy changeover and optimal process management. A drip tray system effectively captures any stray oil, maintaining a clean working environment, while the 4-head design achieves a swift throughput of 4 buckets per minute for 20-liter drums. This machine is the perfect blend of technology and practicality, ideal for businesses seeking enhanced production efficiency and consistent product quality.
